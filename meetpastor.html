                    <p>Pastor John Stevens was born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. Pastor John fell
                        in love with the church at a very young age. He enjoyed going to Sunday School, service
                        as well as the youth activities throughout his whole childhood. At the age of 10, Pastor
                        John gave his life to Christ. When Pastor John was a Senior in High School, he started to
                        feel a call towards ministry. After receiving his acceptance letter to Liberty University
                        in Lynchburg, VA, Pastor John started his studies in Christian Leadership & Church ministry
                        with a concentration in Biblical Studies as well as a minor in Youth Ministries. After
                        graduating from college, Pastor John stayed in the Lynchburg area at a church near Liberty University
                        and started as a Youth Minister. A couple of years went by and Pastor John felt called to Chesterfield,
                        VA where a local church was looking for an associate pastor. During his time there he continued leading
                        youth studies as well as diving more into young adult studies, mostly connecting with the college age
                        students in the church. When he heard about the opening for Senior Pastor at Flint Hill Community
                        Baptist Church, Pastor John quickly jumped at the opportunity and has been leading our church here ever 
                        since.
