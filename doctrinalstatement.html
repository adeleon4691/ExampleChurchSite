                    {1} The Holy Scriptures: We believe the Holy Scriptures to be 
                    the inspired, inerrant, infallible Word of God, and our guide 
                    to faith and practice. {See II Timothy 3:16, 17 and II Peter 1:20, 21.}<br><br>

                    {2} The Godhead: We believe in one God, existing in three persons 
                    - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; eternal in being, identical
                    in nature, equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes 
                    and perfections. {See Matthew 28:18, 19; II Corinthians 13:14.}<br><br>

                    {3} The Person and Work of Christ: We believe that the Lord 
                    Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became Man, being conceived 
                    of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, in order that He 
                    might reveal God and His death on the Cross, His blood being the 
                    purchase price, and that He secured that redemption forever by His 
                    literal resurrection from the dead. 
                    {See John 1:1, 2, 14, 18; Luke 1:35; Romans 3:24, 25, and 4:25.}<br><br>

                    {4}The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit: We believe that the 
                    Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, though omnipresent 
                    from all eternity, took up His abode in the world in a special sense
                    on the day of Pentecost, according to the diving promise and now 
                    indwells every believer, and by His baptism unites all to Christ in 
                    one body, and as the Indwelling One, is the source of all power and 
                    acceptable worship and service. We believe that the Holy Spirit's 
                    ministry to the world is that of conviction respecting sin, 
                    righteousness and judgment. 
                    {See John 14:16, 17; 16:7-11, and I Corinthians 12:13.}<br><br>

                    {5} The Total Depravity of Man: We believe that man was created in 
                    the image and likeness of God, but that in the transgression of Adam 
                    the whole race of mankind fell, and thereby inherited a sinful nature, 
                    became alienated from God and totally unable to retrieve his lost condition. 
                    {See Genesis 1:26, 27; 3:6, 7; Romans 5:12; Ephesians 2:12.}<br><br>

                    {6} Salvation: We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought 
                    to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. 
                    {See Ephesians 2:8-10; and John 1:12.}<br><br>

                    {7} The Eternal Security of the Believer: We believe that all true 
                    believers, once saved, are kept secure forever. {See John 10:27-30.}<br><br>

                    {8} The Church: We believe that the Church is a spiritual organism 
                    composed of all born again persons of this present age irrespective 
                    of their affiliation with Christian organizations, {See Acts 2:47b} 
                    and as such, is both the body and bride of Christ. 
                    {See Ephesians 1:22, 23 and 5:25-27.}<br><br>

                    {9} The Personality of Satan: We believe in the personality of Satan, 
                    who is the open and declared enemy of our Lord Jesus Christ and thereby 
                    the enemy of all who believe in Him. 
                    {See Job 1:6, 7; Matthew 4:2-11; and I Peter 5:8.}<br><br>

                    {10} The Return of Christ: We believe in the imminent, personal 
                    coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for His own, and His subsequent 
                    premillenial return to the earth to set up His kingdom. 
                    {See I Thessalonians 4:13-18; and Acts 15:16-17.}<br><br>

                    {11} The Eternal State: We believe that at death the spirits and 
                    souls of those who have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation
                    pass immediately into His presence, and there remain in conscious bliss
                    until the resurrection of the body at His coming, whereupon soul and body 
                    will be reunited to enjoy the glories and blessings of heaven forever. We 
                    believe also that the souls of those who have rejected Jesus Christ as Saviour 
                    remain after death in conscious misery until the final judgment of the Great 
                    White Throne, when soul and body reunited will be cast into the lake of fire 
                    to be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord. 
                    {See II Corinthians 5:6, 8; Luke 16:19-26; Revelation 20:11-15.}<br><br>

                    {12} Church Ordinances: We believe that water baptism and the Lord's 
                    Supper are the only ordinances of the church and they are the scriptural 
                    means of testimony for the church in this age. We believe that baptism is 
                    the immersion of the believer in water; in the name of the Father, and of 
                    the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; setting forth the essential facts in redemption 
                    - the death, burial and resurrection of Christ; also the essential facts in the 
                    experience of the believer - death to sin and resurrection to newness of life.
                    We believe that the Lord's Supper is a commemoration of His death until He comes 
                    and is to be celebrated at certain intervals by all the members of the church. 
                    {See Matthew 3:13-17 and I Corinthians 11:23-26.}
